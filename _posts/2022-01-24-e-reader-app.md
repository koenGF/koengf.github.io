<center>In 2021, I designed an Android application for reading books, with material design standards in mind.</center>


## Instructions
I was asked to design a website or application. It's purpose was up to me, and it did not need to actually be created.
I decided to design an e-reader application for Android with [OPDS](https://opds.io/) (Open Publication Distribution System) functionality.

## Process
First, I looked for similar applications on the Play Store. My favorites were Google's own [Play Books](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.books), [Lithium](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.faultexception.reader.pro) and [AlReader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.neverland.alreader). For the design, I took inspiration from [the material design documentation](https://material.io), [Solid Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.solidexplorer2) and [BlackPlayer EX](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kodarkooperativet.blackplayerex). [The material design UI kit](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/features/ui-kits.html) was a great help.

## Result
After about two weeks of research and design, this was the result.

{% endcapture %}

My grade was a 9.4 out of 10.
