<center>In 2021, I designed an Android application for reading books, with material design standards in mind.</center>


## Instructions
I was asked to design a website or application. It's purpose was up to me, and it did not need to actually be created.
I decided to design an e-reader application for Android with [OPDS](https://opds.io/){:target="_blank"} (Open Publication Distribution System) functionality.

## Process
First, I looked for similar applications on the Play Store. 
My favorites were Google's own [Play Books](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.books){:target="_blank"}, [Lithium](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.faultexception.reader.pro){:target="_blank"} and [AlReader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.neverland.alreader){:target="_blank"}. 
For the design, I took inspiration from [the material design documentation](https://material.io){:target="_blank"}, [Solid Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.solidexplorer2){:target="_blank"} and [BlackPlayer EX](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kodarkooperativet.blackplayerex){:target="_blank"}. 
[The material design UI kit](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/features/ui-kits.html){:target="_blank"} was a great help.

## Result
After about two weeks of research and design, this was the result.

My grade was a 9.4 out of 10.
