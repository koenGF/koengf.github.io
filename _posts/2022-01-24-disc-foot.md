<center>In 2020, I participated in a two-week greenfoot game jam at school.</center>


## Instructions
We were to learn how to use [greenfoot](https://www.greenfoot.org){:target="_blank"} and make a game with it in 2 weeks. 
I decided to base mine on [Disc Room](https://discroom.com/){:target="_blank"}, a game I was playing at the time.

## Process
At around the same time, a Disc Room game jam was being held on itch.io by the developers, although I did not participate. 
I used some of the sound effects they provided, as well as royalty free music I found on pixabay.com.

## Result
The goal of the game was to collect as many "nuggets" as possible, while avoiding the razor discs bouncing on the walls. 
More discs are added as the player gains more points.
